# == Class: nrsysmond
#
# This module manages the New Relic Server Agent.
#
# === Parameters
#
# [*license_key*]
#   40-character alphanumeric string provided by New Relic. This is required in
#   order for the server monitor to start.
#
# [*hostname*]
#   Sets the hostname of the server as it appears in New Relic. If not
#   specified, the OS-level hostname will be used.
#   Caution: The New Relic user interface uses the hostname to link monitored
#   applications to the server they are running on. Using the hostname
#   configuration setting in the nrsysmond.cfg file may cause a different name
#   to be reported for the server than what is reported by any monitored
#   applications. This difference may cause the linkage between the application
#   and the server in the New Relic user interface to break.
#   See https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/servers/new-relic-servers-linux/maintenance/changing-linux-server-name#configuration-file
#   **Default**: undef
#
# [*nrloglevel*]
#   Level of detail you want in the log file (as defined by the logfile
#   setting below. Valid values are (in increasing levels of verbosity):
#   error        - show errors only
#   warning      - show errors and warnings
#   info         - show minimal additional information messages
#   verbose      - show more detailed information messages
#   debug        - show debug messages
#   verbosedebug - show very detailed debug messages
#   **Default**: info
#
# [*nrlogifle*]
#   Name of the file where the server monitor will store it's log messages. The amount
#   of detail stored in this file is controlled
#   by the loglevel option (above).
#   **Default**: /var/log/newrelic/nrsysmond.log
#
# [*proxy*]
#   The name and optional login credentials of the proxy server to use
#   for all communication with the New Relic collector. In its simplest
#   form this setting is just a hostname[:port] setting. The default
#   port if none is specified is 1080. If your proxy requires a user
#   name, use the syntax user@host[:port]. If it also requires a
#   password use the format user:password@host[:port]. For example:
#     fred:secret@proxy.mydomain.com:8181
#
# [*ssl*]
#   Whether or not to use the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) for all
#   communication with the New Relic collector. Possible values are
#   true/on or false/off. In certain rare cases you may need to modify
#   the SSL certificates settings below.
#   **Default**: false
#
# [*ssl_ca_bundle*]
#   The name of a PEM-encoded Certificate Authority (CA) bundle to use
#   for SSL connections. This very rarely needs to be set. The monitor
#   will attempt to find the bundle in the most common locations. If
#   you need to use SSL and the monitor is unable to locate a CA bundle
#   then either set this value or the ssl_ca_path option below.
#   **Default**: /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt or
#            /etc/pki/tls/certs/ca-bundle.crt
#
# [*ssl_ca_path*]
#   If your SSL installation does not use CA bundles, but rather has a
#   directory with PEM-encoded Certificate Authority files, set this
#   option to the name of the directory that contains all the CA files.
#   **Default**: /etc/ssl/certs
#
# [*nrpidfile*]
#   Name of a file where the server monitoring daemon will store its
#   process ID (PID). This is used by the startup and shutdown script
#   to determine if the monitor is already running, and to start it up
#   or shut it down.
#   **Default**: /tmp/nrsysmond.pid
#
# [*collector_host*]
#   The name of the New Relic collector to connect to. This should only
#   ever be changed on the advice of New Relic support staff.
#   The format is host[:port]. Using a port number of 0 means the default
#   port, which is 80 (if not using the ssl option - see below) or 443
#   if SSL is enabled. If the port is omitted the default value is used.
#   **Default**: collector.newrelic.com
#
# [*timeout*]
#   How long the monitor should wait to contact the collector host. If
#   the connection cannot be established in this period of time, the
#   monitor will progressively back off in 15-second increments, up to
#   a maximum of 300 seconds. Once the initial connection has been
#   established, this value is reset back to the value specified here
#   (or the default). This then sets the maximum time to wait for
#   a connection to the collector to report data. There is no back-off
#   once the original connection has been made. The value is in seconds.
#   **Default**: 30
#
# [*version]
#   The version of nrsysmond to install. Usually you would leave this at
#   the default of 'latest', but if you prefer a specific release you may
#   specify a version number here as a string.
#   **Default**: latest
#
# [*labels]
#   A hash of label names and values for categories that will be
#   applied to the data sent from this agent.
#   **Default**: undef
